Mapping Earthquake Analysis Report
1.	Overview of the analysis:
o	The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world by creating interactive maps using GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.

o	We used the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from USA geological survey website. Then, we ultra versed and retrieved the earthquake data using JavaScript, D3, Leaflet and plot the data in a mapbox through an API request.

2.	Results: 
o	After we retrieved the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON, we then used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. See the image below.

4.	Summary:
o	One way we can tell stories with data is through interactive maps. Maps allow us to explore, understand and make decisions about our world. JavaScript, D3, Leaflet and Mapbox allow us to create interactive maps using GeoJSON that are easy to read.
